# Hello 👋


**Distributed Systems | Cloud & Infrastructure | Applied Machine Learning**

I design and build large-scale systems across compute, networking, storage, and data platforms.
My work sits at the intersection of distributed backend systems, infrastructure automation, and correctness at scale.

I am currently deepening my expertise through a **Machine Learning Specialization**, integrating intelligent modeling with production-grade data systems.

---

## Engineering Focus

* Distributed backend architecture
* Infrastructure automation (compute + SDN)
* Systems reliability & concurrency
* Data integrity & large-scale migrations
* Linux-based environments across stack layers
* Applied machine learning foundations

---

## Selected Projects

### machine-learning

Applied ML implementations covering regression, classification, feature engineering, encoding strategies, and evaluation methodologies.
Focused on understanding bias-variance tradeoffs and production-aligned modeling workflows.

## Large-Scale Enterprise data migration reconciliation

Designed and implemented a core reconciliation engine ensuring data integrity and correctness during high-volume financial data processing and cloud migration initiatives.

## Synthetic Data Engineering Framework

Built a synthetic data generation system to simulate financial transaction patterns, edge cases, and stress scenarios.

### Dynamic-Query-Generator

A backend abstraction layer for dynamically constructing optimized queries based on runtime conditions.
Designed for extensibility, composability, and performance awareness in data-intensive systems.

**Core themes:** abstraction design, runtime optimization, backend correctness.

---

### NSX-T Automation

Automation framework for software-defined networking workflows, enabling programmatic provisioning and configuration management.

**Core themes:** API-driven infrastructure, SDN orchestration, operational reliability.

---

### vcenter-automation

Compute virtualization automation toolkit supporting lifecycle management and environment standardization.

**Core themes:** systems orchestration, infrastructure APIs, scalable automation patterns.

---



**Core themes:** statistical foundations, model evaluation, data-to-model pipelines.

---

### gosphere

Systems-oriented backend experimentation emphasizing performance, modularity, and clean service boundaries.

**Core themes:** concurrency, service design, systems-level thinking.

---

### NSX-V Automation

Automation utilities for legacy virtual networking environments with emphasis on compatibility, integration, and operational continuity.

**Core themes:** real-world constraints, system integration, stability under change.

---

## Technical Stack

**Languages:** Python, Java
**Systems:** Linux, distributed environments
**Cloud:** AWS architecture patterns
**Infra Domains:** Compute, storage, networking, SDN
**Backend:** REST APIs, service design
**Data:** Pandas, feature engineering, modeling fundamentals
**Tooling:** Docker, Git

---

## Engineering Philosophy

* Correctness before scale
* Observability by design
* Automate what repeats
* Build systems that degrade gracefully

---

## Current Direction

Bridging distributed systems and machine learning — designing platforms where data reliability, system performance, and intelligent decision-making coexist.

If you'd like, I can now refine this into:

* A **more minimal, high-signal FAANG-style version**
* A **Principal Engineer positioning version**
* Or a slightly more human, less formal tone version**
